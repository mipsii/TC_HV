Hello
After multiple problems with my computer, I managed to do . I worked several times, the first version ran into a loop from which it could not get out, and I could not find it.
At the start I could not install the Virtual Machine. Then replaced the HDD. Windows problems. Problems with Virtual Disk again. And it ended up working very slowly and that's when I gave up on it. (i5 with 8GB)
by then maybe more than 2 months had passed and then I got annoyed and gave up.
2-3 weeks ago, started working again. from 0.
this is what i am sending you
According to me with Scope View. Bad attemts. I probably have some hardware problem with my computer
Sa svim kontrolama i indikacijama, to radi. 
With all controls and indications, it works.
